## Understanding the need

Code deployments are a hassle. You have to manually pull in your code, install dependencies, build assets, run migrations, and finally bring your application back online. This is a lot of manual work and can be error-prone.

::: details Example of a Laravel deployment
You're supposed to put your application into maintenance mode before deploying with `php artisan down`, pull in your code, clear the cache with `php artisan cache:clear`, install dependencies with `composer install` and `npm install`, then build your assets with `npm run production`, run migrations with `php artisan migrate`, and finally bring your application back online with `php artisan up`. Remember to restart `php-fpm` and `nginx` after the deployment, and queue workers with `php artisan queue:restart` if you use them.

This is just a basic example, but you get the idea.

Tools like [Deployer](https://deployer.org/) can automate deployment scenarios and run from your local environnement. To work successfully they need a configuration and have to be ran manually everytime you want to deploy your website.

On the other hand, there are paid tools like [Envoyer.io](https://envoyer.io) that offer a higher level of automation by performing the deployment online, in a completely automated way for each push you do. Problem, these services are not free, or some with a free-tier which limits the number of projects.

Rocket provides the benefits from both tools without the cons.
